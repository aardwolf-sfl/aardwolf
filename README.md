# Aardwolf: A Modular Tool for Software Fault Localization

Aardwolf is<sup>1</sup> a software fault localization<sup>2</sup> tool with focus on

* *Extensibility* -- It should be possible and convenient to implement or extend a technique
* *Language independence* -- All implemented techniques should be available to many programming languages and implementing a new frontend should be reasonably difficult
* *User experience* -- The tool should be actually usable, which not only means
  accurate, but also offering rich output, being scalable and allowing
  convenient integration into real-world projects

<sup>1</sup> will be

<sup>2</sup> *Software fault localization* (SFL) is an area of research that
aims to help programmers with understanding program errors and locating their
cause by developing techniques that partially or fully automate the
localization of faults in the source code.

## Status

*The tool is now under a complete rewrite. See
[legacy](https://github.com/aardwolf-sfl/aardwolf/tree/legacy) branch for the
original version.*
